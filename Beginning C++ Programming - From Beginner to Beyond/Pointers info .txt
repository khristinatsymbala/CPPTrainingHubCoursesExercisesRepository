What is Pointer?

1) A variable - whose value is an address
2) What can be at that address - another variable, a function
3)To use the data that the pointer is pointing to you MUST know its type

Why use a pointers?

1) Inside function< pointers can be used to access data that are defined outside the function.
Those variables, may not be in scope so you can`t access them by their name

2) Pointers can be used to operate on arrays

3) We can allocate memory dynamically on the heap or free store 
    - This memory doesn`t even have a variable name 
    - The only way to get to it is via pointer

4) With OOP pointers are polymorphysm work!

5) Can access specific addresses in memory
    - useful in embedded and systems applications

Declaring a pointer
        variable_type *pointer_name;  int *int_ptr;

Initizing pointer:
        variable_type *pointer_name {nulptr};  int *int_ptr{};

Initizing pointer variables to 'point nowhere'
    - Always initialize pointers
    - Uninitialize pointers contain garbage data and can 'point anywhere'
    - initializt to zero or nullptr(C++ 11) represent address zero
        - implies that the pointer is 'pointing nowhere'
    - If you don`t want initialize a pointer to point to a variable or function
        then you should initialize it to nullptr to 'make it null'

Accessing Pointer address
& the address operator

-variable are stored in unique addresses
-Unary operator (+ -)
- Evaluate tothe address of its operand
    - operand cannot be a constant or expression that evaluates to temp value
    - операнд не може бути константою або виразом, який обчислюється як тимчасове значення



size of a pointer variable
- don`t confuse the size of a pointer and the size of what it points to
- All pointers in program have the same size
- They may be pointing to very large or very small types


Typed pointers:
    The compiler will make sure that the address stored in a pointer variable is of correct type
