Potencial Pointer Pitfalls:
    - Uninitialize pointers 

        int *int_ptr; //ointing anywhere
        .....
        *int_ptr = 100; //Hopefully a crash

        - Pointer that is pointing to released memory 
            - For example, 2 pointers point to the same data
            - 1 pointer releases the data with delete
            - The other pointer accesses the release data

        - Pointer that points to memory that is inalid
            - We saw this when we returned a pointer to a function local variable
        
    - Not checking if new failed to allocate memory
        - If new fails an exception is thrown - Якщо new не вдається, створюється виняток
        - We can use exception handling to catch exceptions - Ми можемо використовувати обробку винятків, щоб перехопити винятки
        - Dereferencing a null pointer will cause your program to crash - Розіменування нульового вказівника призведе до збою програми

    - Leaking memory
        - Forgetting to reliase allocated memory with delete
        - If you lose your pointer to the storage allocated on the heap you have not way to get to that storage again 
            - for example But what if you lose the pointer, say you allocated the memory in a function and the pointer
            was declared in the function and the function terminates. Now you just lost your pointer.
            There's no way you can reference that allocated memory on the heap.
        - The memory is orphaned or leaked
        - One of the most common pointer problems
