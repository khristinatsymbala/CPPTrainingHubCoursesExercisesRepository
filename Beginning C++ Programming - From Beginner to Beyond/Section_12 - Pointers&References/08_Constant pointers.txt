Passing pointers to a function
    const and Pointers

    There are several ways to qualify pointers using const:
        1) Pointers to constants
            - The data pointed to by the pointers is constant and cannot be changed;
            - The pointer itself change and point somewhere else;

                int hight score {100};
                int low score {65};
                const int *score_ptr{&high_score};

                *score_ptr = 86; //ERROR
                score_ptr = &low_score; // OK

 
        2) Constant pointers
            - The data pointed to by the pointerd can be changed;
            - The pointer itself cannot change and point somewhere else;

                int hight score {100};
                int low score {65};
                int *const score_ptr{&high_score};

                *score_ptr = 86; //OK
                score_ptr = &low_score; // ERROR

        3) Constant pointers to constants 
            - The data pointed to by the pointer is constant and be changed;
            - The pointer itself cannot change and point somewhere else;

                 int hight score {100};
                int low score {65};
                const int *const score_ptr{&high_score};

                *score_ptr = 86; //ERROR
                score_ptr = &low_score; // ERROR
